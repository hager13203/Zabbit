# Zabbit 🐰

Zabbit is a simple social media app built with **React** and **Material UI**. It displays a feed of posts and serves as a practice project to explore Material UI components, React Router, and React Hooks.
> 💡 This project was my **first-time practice using Material UI** to learn how to build responsive, styled components using the library.
